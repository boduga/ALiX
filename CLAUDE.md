# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **ALiX** (34171 symbols, 77159 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> Index stale? Run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze` from the project root — it auto-selects an available runner. No `.gitnexus/run.cjs` yet? `npx gitnexus analyze` (npm 11 crash → `npm i -g gitnexus`; #1939).

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows. For regression review, compare against the default branch: `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})`.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `query({search_query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `context({name: "symbolName"})`.
- For security review, `explain({target: "fileOrSymbol"})` lists taint findings (source→sink flows; needs `analyze --pdg`).

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `detect_changes()` to check affected scope.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

## opensrc — Source Code Context

Key dependency source code is cached locally via opensrc and available as context.
The cache is symlinked into `.opensrc/repos` for project-local access.

Use `npx opensrc path <org/repo>` to get the absolute path, or reference opensrc
by name when asking about implementation details — the source code is available
locally and provides the ground truth for any API or framework.

Currently cached (all at `.opensrc/repos/` → `~/.opensrc/repos/`):
- `microsoft/typescript` — `.opensrc/repos/github.com/microsoft/typescript/main/`
- `facebook/react` — `.opensrc/repos/github.com/facebook/react/main/`
- `lukeed/ms` — `.opensrc/repos/github.com/lukeed/ms/master/`
- `pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus` — `.opensrc/repos/github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus/dev/`

Add more with: `npx opensrc fetch <org/repo>`

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues and PRDs live as GitHub issues (repo `boduga/ALiX`); use the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical triage roles map to `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: read `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root and `docs/adr/` when they exist; proceed silently if absent. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
