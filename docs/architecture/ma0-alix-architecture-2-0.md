# MA0 — ALiX Architecture 2.0

> **Status:** Proposed architecture governance milestone  
> **Purpose:** Formalize ALiX’s long-term architecture, roadmap taxonomy, ownership boundaries, and dependency rules.  
> **Applies to:** All future ALiX design specs, implementation plans, PR reviews, architectural decisions, and agentic execution workflows.  
> **Recommended repo path:** `docs/architecture/ma0-alix-architecture-2-0.md`

## 1. Why MA0 Exists

ALiX has outgrown a single linear roadmap.

The project now contains at least two visible milestone families:

- **M-series** — early platform / coordination / runtime infrastructure
- **P-series** — product intelligence, governance, adaptation, executive decision loops

The P-series has become mature and coherent, especially through P4–P10.  
The M-series contains important foundational work, but it is not yet formalized as a complete platform roadmap.

MA0 creates the missing architectural layer.

It establishes ALiX as a three-roadmap system:

```text
M-Series = Platform
P-Series = Product Intelligence
A-Series = Autonomous Evolution
```

This prevents architectural drift and gives future agents a clear rulebook for where features belong.

```

### Summary

| Roadmap | Meaning | Primary Question |
|---|---|---|
| **M** | Platform | How does ALiX work? |
| **P** | Product Intelligence | What does ALiX do? |
| **A** | Autonomous Evolution | How does ALiX improve itself? |

---

## 3. M-Series — Platform Roadmap

The M-series owns ALiX’s reusable operating system.

It should provide stable primitives consumed by all higher-level capabilities.

### Responsibilities

- Runtime
- Agent lifecycle
- Worker framework
- Scheduling
- Coordination
- Context management
- Memory infrastructure
- Planning primitives
- Tool framework
- Model abstraction
- Storage primitives
- Event bus
- Observability
- Security primitives
- Workspace safety

### Rule

> **M-series code must not depend on P-series or A-series code.**

The platform must remain domain-neutral.

---

## 4. P-Series — Product Intelligence Roadmap

The P-series owns ALiX’s user-facing intelligence capabilities.

It consumes M-series platform primitives and turns them into workflows, governance, adaptation, learning, and executive decision-making.

### Responsibilities

- Workflow execution
- Adaptation proposals
- Proposal lifecycle
- Governance
- Learning engine
- Executive health reports
- Outcome evaluation
- Recommendation generation
- Recommendation persistence
- Recommendation bridge to governance
- Recommendation effectiveness intelligence

### Rule

> **P-series code may depend on M-series contracts, but must not duplicate M-series infrastructure.**

---

## 5. A-Series — Autonomous Evolution Roadmap

The A-series owns ALiX’s future self-improvement capabilities.

It sits above the P-series and uses both platform and product intelligence to improve ALiX itself.

### Responsibilities

- Self-assessment
- Goal management
- Agent generation
- Workflow synthesis
- Architecture evolution
- Code evolution
- Capability discovery
- Strategy refinement
- Self-directed engineering
- Long-horizon improvement loops

### Rule

> **A-series code may consume M and P capabilities, but must not bypass governance.**

Autonomy must remain governed, explainable, and reversible.

---

## 8. Platform Contract

The M-series exposes stable contracts that P and A milestones may consume.

Recommended contract documents:

```text
docs/architecture/platform-contract.md
docs/architecture/product-contract.md
docs/architecture/autonomy-contract.md
```

### M-Series Platform Contract

The platform should expose:

- `RuntimeAPI`
- `WorkerAPI`
- `ToolAPI`
- `MemoryAPI`
- `ContextAPI`
- `StorageAPI`
- `EventAPI`
- `SchedulerAPI`
- `ModelAPI`
- `ObservabilityAPI`
- `SecurityAPI`

### Rule

> A P milestone may only depend on documented platform APIs, not internal M implementation details.

---

## 9. Product Contract

The P-series exposes product intelligence capabilities to the A-series.

Examples:

- `ProposalStore`
- `OutcomeReportStore`
- `RecommendationReportStore`
- `ExecutiveTrendStore`
- `GovernanceProposalBridge`
- `RecommendationEffectivenessAnalyzer`

### Rule

> A-series autonomy must use P-series contracts rather than directly mutating product state.

---

## 10. Autonomy Contract

The A-series must remain governed.

Any autonomous action that changes code, architecture, agents, tools, workflows, policies, or persistent state must go through:

```text
Propose → Review → Approve → Apply → Measure
```

### Rule

> A-series may recommend and propose, but must not silently mutate governed state.

---

## 11. Required Sections in Future Specs

Every future design spec must include these sections.

### 11.1 Roadmap Classification

```markdown
## Roadmap Classification

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Roadmap | M / P / A |
| Layer | Platform / Product / Autonomy |
| Depends On | ... |
| Owns | ... |
```

### 11.2 Dependency Declaration

```markdown
## Dependencies

| Capability | Provider | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| Memory | M-Series | MemoryAPI |
| Proposal lifecycle | P-Series | ProposalStore |
```

### 11.3 Boundary Statement

```markdown
## Hard Boundary

This milestone may:
- ...

This milestone may not:
- ...
```

### 11.4 Ownership Declaration

```markdown
## Ownership

This milestone owns:
- ...

This milestone consumes:
- ...
```

---

## 12. Dependency Rules

### Rule 1 — Platform Independence

M-series milestones must not import or depend on P-series or A-series modules.

### Rule 2 — Product Uses Platform

P-series milestones may depend on M-series contracts.

### Rule 3 — Autonomy Uses Product and Platform

A-series milestones may depend on P-series and M-series contracts.

### Rule 4 — No Reverse Dependency

Lower layers must never depend on higher layers.

### Rule 5 — No Duplication

If a capability belongs to M, P and A must consume it rather than reimplementing it.

### Rule 6 — Missing Primitive Creates Platform Work

If a P or A milestone needs a new generic primitive, create an M milestone first.

### Rule 7 — Autonomy Must Be Governed

A-series changes must pass through the proposal/governance lifecycle.

## 17. Repository Organization Target

Current structure may remain during transition, but the long-term organization should clarify ownership.

Recommended target:

```text
src/
  platform/
    runtime/
    workers/
    tools/
    memory/
    context/
    planning/
    orchestration/
    observability/
    security/

  product/
    workflow/
    adaptation/
    governance/
    learning/
    executive/
    recommendations/

  autonomy/
    assessment/
    goals/
    agents/
    workflows/
    architecture/
    code/
    knowledge/
```

Migration should be incremental. Do not reorganize the repository without a dedicated migration milestone.

---

## 18. PR Review Rules

Every PR must answer:

1. Which roadmap does this belong to?
2. Which layer owns the changed files?
3. Are dependency directions valid?
4. Does this duplicate a lower-layer capability?
5. Does this introduce a new platform primitive?
6. Does this require an M milestone first?
7. Does this mutate governed state?
8. Does it need evidence, audit, or approval?
9. Are tests aligned with the layer?
10. Are docs updated?

---

## 19. Legacy PR Handling

Old PRs from the M0.xx era should not be merged directly if they conflict with current main or predate the P-series architecture.

Each old PR should be classified as:

| Classification | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Superseded | Current architecture already covers it | Close |
| Valuable concept | Idea still useful, implementation stale | Re-spec as new M/P/A slice |
| Still valid | Applies cleanly to current architecture | Review normally |
| Historical | Useful only as reference | Close with note |

### Rule

> Never merge unrelated-history PRs directly into current main.

Use old branches as design references, not merge targets.

---

## 20. Architecture Decision Records

All major architectural changes should use ADRs.

Recommended path:

```text
docs/architecture/adrs/
```

ADR template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX — Title

## Status

Proposed / Accepted / Superseded

## Context

## Decision

## Consequences

## Alternatives Considered

## Related Milestones
```

---

## 21. Definition of Done for Architecture Milestones

An architecture milestone is not complete until it includes:

- Design spec
- Implementation plan
- Dependency declaration
- Boundary statement
- Tests
- Documentation
- Review checklist
- Migration notes if applicable
- Supersession notes if replacing older work

---

## 22. MA0 Deliverables

MA0 should deliver the following:

- This architecture governance document
- Platform contract document
- Product contract document
- Autonomy contract document
- Roadmap map for M/P/A
- Ownership matrix
- Dependency rules
- PR review checklist
- Legacy PR classification process
- ADR template
- Migration strategy for old M-series work

---

## 23. Immediate Next Steps

Recommended follow-up slices:

```text
MA0a — Commit Architecture 2.0 governance document
MA0b — Write Platform Contract
MA0c — Write Product Contract
MA0d — Write Autonomy Contract
MA0e — Create M/P/A roadmap index
MA0f — Classify legacy PRs
MA0g — Add architecture review checklist
```

---

## 24. Final Principle

ALiX should evolve without losing architectural coherence.

The M/P/A model gives ALiX a stable long-term structure:

```text
M = the platform ALiX runs on
P = the intelligence ALiX provides
A = the autonomy ALiX grows into
```

Every future milestone should preserve that separation.
